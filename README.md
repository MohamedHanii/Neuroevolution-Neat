# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)

A Java implementation of the NEAT algorithm for neuroevolution, designed to solve reinforcement learning tasks through evolutionary computation of neural network architectures.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements the NEAT algorithm, which is a genetic algorithm that evolves both the topology and weights of neural networks. NEAT is particularly effective for solving complex problems where the optimal network structure is not known in advance.

## ✨ Features

- **NEAT Algorithm Implementation**: Complete implementation of the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm
- **Multiple Task Environments**: Support for XOR, CartPole, and CartPole Random tasks
- **Innovation Tracking**: Proper handling of structural mutations and innovation numbers
- **Species Management**: Automatic speciation to protect topological innovations
- **Fitness Sharing**: Balanced selection pressure across species
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage with multiple testing frameworks
- **Visualization**: Built-in visualization for trained agents
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with configurable parameters

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## 🔬 Algorithm Details

### NEAT Core Principles

1. **Topological Innovation**: Networks can add/remove nodes and connections
2. **Innovation Tracking**: Each structural change gets a unique innovation number
3. **Speciation**: Networks are grouped by topological similarity
4. **Fitness Sharing**: Selection pressure is balanced across species
5. **Elitism**: Best members of each species are preserved

### Evolution Process

1. **Initialization**: Create minimal networks for each input/output
2. **Evaluation**: Test networks on the target task
3. **Speciation**: Group similar networks into species
4. **Selection**: Select parents based on shared fitness
5. **Reproduction**: Apply crossover and mutation
6. **Replacement**: Create new generation while preserving elites
